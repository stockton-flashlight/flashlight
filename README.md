Introduction
============

This project is intended to introduce some basic concepts from electronic and
mechanical design. There is a small amount of soldering and a small amount of
assembly the result of which is a working and powerful flashlight.

The latest version of this documentation and of the Flashlight project is
available at https://github.com/stockton-flashlight/flashlight or
https://git.flirble.org/flashlight/flashlight .

The design is not without flaws however, and deliberately so. As you build the
flashlight you should pay attention to the steps and ask yourself how you
might improve it.
